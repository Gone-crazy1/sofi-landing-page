# Favicon Instructions

Place your favicon.ico file in this directory:
/assets/favicon.ico

Your favicon should be:
- 16x16 or 32x32 pixels
- .ico format (preferred) or .png format
- Contains your SOFI logo/brand

Current favicon setup in index.html points to:
./assets/favicon.ico

Once you upload your favicon.ico file here, it will automatically show up in browser tabs instead of the default Render logo.
